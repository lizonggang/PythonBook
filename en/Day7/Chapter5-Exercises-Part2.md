**Question 1**

Write a program that reads n < 1000 then n numbers each of which is between 1 and 1000 inclusively. Then, your program will find the numbers that exist more than once and output them in **<u>increasing</u>** order. You **<u>cannot</u>** use nested loops.

**For example:**

Input|Result
-|-
10|1
3 4 6 1 3 7 1 1000 3 6|3
&nbsp;|6

<br>

**Question 2**

Write a program that reads n < 1000 then n distinct numbers each of which is between 1 and 1000 inclusively. Then, your program will output the numbers in ascending order. You **<u>cannot</u>** use nested loops.

**For example:**

Input|Result
-|-
5|1
4 1 1000 3 6|3
&nbsp;|4
&nbsp;|6
&nbsp;|1000

<br>

**Question 3**

Write a program that reads n < 1000 then n numbers each of which is between 1 and 1000 inclusively. Then, your program will output the numbers in ascending order. Note that numbers may not be distinct this time. You **<u>cannot</u>** use nested loops.

**For example:**

Input|Result
-|-
10|1
3 4 6 1 3 7 1 1000 3 6|1
&nbsp;|3
&nbsp;|3
&nbsp;|3
&nbsp;|4
&nbsp;|6
&nbsp;|6
&nbsp;|7
&nbsp;|1000

<br>

**Question 4**

Write a program that outputs the intersection of two sets of sizes n < 100 and m < 100. Each number in the array is between -1000 and 1000 inclusively. Read n, then n numbers; read m, then m numbers. Your program should output the numbers in increasing order. You **<u>cannot</u>** use nested loops.

**For example:**

Input|Result
-|-
5|30 40 50
30 -111 40 50 28|
6|
892 30 40 50 0 -892|

<br>

**Question 5**

Write a program that gives a sorted output of numbers given in two sorted arrays in ascending order of sizes n < 100 and m < 100. Each number in the arrays is between -1000 and 1000 inclusively. Read n, then n numbers; read m, then m numbers. Write the sorted output on the screen in ascending order. You **<u>cannot</u>** use nested loops.

**For example:**

Input|Result
-|-
6|-18 3 4 9 12 12 36 66 156 876 991
3 4 9 12 36 991|
5|
-18 12 66 156 876|

<br>

**Question 6**

Write a program that gives a sorted output of numbers given in two sorted arrays in ascending order of sizes n < 100 and m < 100. <u>The numbers in the array may not be between -1000 and 1000</u>. Read n, then n numbers; read m, then m numbers. Write the sorted output on screen in ascending order. You **<u>cannot</u>** use nested loops.

**For example:**

Input|Result
-|-
6|-18 3 4 9 12 12 36 66 156 876 2191
3 4 9 12 36 2191|
5|
-18 12 66 156 876|
