**Question 1**

Write a function NumLetters returns the number of letters in a given string.

For example:

```
Test                                    Result
print(NumLetters("I8-10caKes!"))        6
```

**Question 2**

Write a function named UpperCase that converts all letters to uppercase in a given string.

For example:

```
Test                                    Result
print(UpperCase("I8-10caKes!"))         I8-10CAKES!
```

**Question 3**

Write a function named SameWords that checks if two given strings are the same regardless of the case differences. If the strings are equal, function returns 1, otherwise 0.

For example:

```
Test                                    Result
if SameWords("Trivial", "Trival"):      not same
    print("same")
else:
    print("not same")

if SameWords("tRiViAl", "TrIvIaL"):     same
    print("same")
else:
    print("not same")
```

**Question 4**

Write a function named Reverse that reverses a given string.

For example:

```
Test                                    Result
print(Reverse("!esreveR"))              Reverse!
```

**Question 5**

Write a program that reads three strings from the keyboard and checks if the number of vowels in these strings are equal.

For example:

```
Test                                    Result
ThReE GOOD VoWeLs                       Same number of vowels.

For example:

```
Test                                    Result
I8-10caKes! has3digits                  4
```

**Question 7**

Write a program that reads two numbers x, y and a character c from the keyboard. The program outputs two squares with the sizes x and y filled with character c.


For example:

```
输入                                    Result
3 5 #                                   ###
                                        ###
