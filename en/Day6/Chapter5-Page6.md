###### Programming with Python
---

**5.9\*\*)** Write a program that outputs the intersection of two sets of sizes /i < 100 and m < 100. Each number in the array is between -1000 and 1000 inclusively.
Read n, then n numbers; read m, then m numbers.

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
5                           30 40 50
30 -111 40 50 28
6
892 30 40 50 0 -892
```

**5.10\*\*\*)** Write a program that gives a sorted output of numbers given in two
sorted arrays of sizes n < 100 and m < 100. Each number in the array is between
-1000 and 1000 inclusively. Read n, then n numbers; read m, then m numbers.
Write the sorted output on the screen.

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
6                           -18 3 4 9 12 12 36 66 156 876 991
3 4 9 12 36 991
5
-18 12 66 156 876
```

**5.11\*\*\*)** Write a program that gives a sorted output of numbers given in two
sorted arrays of sizes n < 100 and m < 100. <u>The numbers in the array may not be
between -1000 and 1000</u>. Read n, then n numbers; read m, then m numbers. Write
the sorted output on the screen.

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
6                           -18 3 4 9 12 12 36 66 156 876 2191
3 4 9 12 36 2191
5
-18 12 66 156 876
```
