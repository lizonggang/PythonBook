### 5.4. Exercises

**5.3)** Write a program that reads n numbers (n =< 20) from the keyboard and puts
them into an array. Then add all the numbers in the array, and output the sum. The
user first inputs n from the keyboard then the numbers.

```
Sample input:         Sample output:
6                       24
9 10 7 0 -5 3
```


**5.4\*)** Read n numbers (n =< 20) from the keyboard and put them into an array.
Then write the numbers in the array that are divisible by 3 or 5.

```
Sample input:           Sample output:
7                       15
15 19 7 21 6 37 18      21
                        6
                        18
```

**5.5\*\*)** Given n numbers (n =< 20) find if the sequence of numbers is symmetric or not If the sequence of numbers is symmetric, write “symmetric”, otherwise write
“not symmetric”, on the screen.


```
Sample input1:          Sample output1:
8                       not syimnetric
15 19 7 21 6 37 18 1
```

```
Sample input2:          Sample output2:
7                       symmetric
15 19 7 21 7 19 15
```

**5.6\*\*)** Write a program that reads n < 100 then n numbers each of which is
between 1 and 1000 inclusively from the input. Then, your program will find the
numbers that exist more than once and write them on the screen.

**5.7\*\*)** Write a program that reads n < 100 then n distinct numbers each of which is between 1 and 1000 inclusively from the input. Then, your program will write the numbers on the screen in sorted order from smaller to larger.

**5.8\*\*\*)** Write a program that reads n < 100 then n numbers each of which is
between 1 and 1000 inclusively from the input. Then, your program will write the
numbers on the screen in sorted order from smaller to larger. <u>Note that numbers
may not be distinct</u>.
