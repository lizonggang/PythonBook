**Question 1.** Write a program that outputs only the numbers that have remainder 3 when divided by 7. The program stops when 0 is entered.

**For example:**

```
Input                   Result
9                       10
10                      185
11                      3
185
7
3
0
```

<br>

**Question 2.** Write a program that outputs the sum of the squares of the given numbers. The program stops when 0 is entered.

**For example:**

```
Input                   Result
9                       239
10
7
3
0
```

**Question 3.** Given a positive integer n, write a program that applies the following procedure until n becomes 1. if n is even, divide n by 2. Otherwise, multiply n by three and add 1 to it. Print integer value of n in each step

**For example:**

```
Input                   Result
40                      40
                        20
                        10
                        5
                        16
                        8
                        4
                        2
                        1
```

<br>

**Question 4.** Write a program that outputs the sum of the first 5 numbers. The program terminates when the input is 0 (it is guaranteed that there are at least 5 numbers).

**For example:**

```
Input                   Result
9                       222
10
11
185
7
3
12
4
1001
0
```

<br>

**Question 5.** Write a program that outputs the sum of the first 5 numbers and the last number (the number before 0). The program terminates when the input is 0 (it is guaranteed that there are at least 5 numbers).

**For example:**

```
Input                   Result
9                       1223
10
11
185
7
3
12
4
1001
0
```

**Question 6.** Write a program which prints all two-digit numbers that can be composed of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

**Question 7.** Write a program which prints all two-digit numbers that can be composed of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} in the following order:

```
             50 51 52 53 54 55 40 41 42 43 44 45 ... 10 11 12 13 14 15
```

Be careful that ones digit increases while tens digit decreases.


**Question 8.** Write a program which prints all two digit odd numbers that can be composed of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

**Question 9.** Write a program which prints all three digit numbers that can be composed of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

**Question 10.**Write a program that finds all the 3-digit numbers that composed of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and whose digits are distinct.
