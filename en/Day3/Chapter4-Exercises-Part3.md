**Question 1.** Write a program that reverses the given number.

**For example:**

```
Input                   Result
2431                    1342
```

<br>

**Question 2.** Write a program that reads two numbers N (0 < N < 10) and M (0 < M < 25) from the input. Then, your program will print a figure on the screen that has N number of rows and M number of columns. The first row will have with M number of 1s, and the second row will have M number of 2s. It will continue until the Nth row will have M number of Ns. See the example below for clarity.

**For example:**

```
Input                   Result
3                       1111
4                       2222
                        3333
```
<br>

**Question 3.** Write a program that reads a number N (0 < N < 25) from the input. Then, your program will print a figure on the screen that has N rows in triangle from. The first row will have only 1, and the second row will have 1 and 2. It will continue until the Nth row will have the numbers from 1 to N. See the example below for clarity. Be careful about the blank between numbers.

**For example:**

```
Input                   Result
4                       1
                        1 2
                        1 2 3
                        1 2 3 4
```

**Question 4.** Write a program that reads a number N then N numbers from the input. Your program will print a figure on the screen that has N rows. The numbers given in the input specify the number of '*' in their row consequently. See the example below for clarity.

**For example:**

```
Input                   Result
5                       ***
3                       ****
4                       ******
6
0                       ***
3
```

**Question 5.** Write a program which prints the output below when 4 and 7 are given as input. The program reads two numbers; N and M from keyboard.

**For example:**

```
Input                   Result
4                       1 2 3 4 5 6 7
7                       2 3 4 5 6 7 8
                        3 4 5 6 7 8 9
                        4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

<br>

**Question 6.** Write a program which finds the primes that are less than the given number N <= 25,000.

**For example:**

```
Input                   Result
20                      2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19
```
