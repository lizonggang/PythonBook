###### Programming with Python
---

For instance, in Python, '``Mybox = 4``' doesn't mean '``Mybox`` and 4 are equal'; it means 'put 4 into ``Mybox``'.

We can also put a decimal number into a variable. For example,

```python
Mybox = 4.78
```

puts 4.78 in ``Mybox``. If we would like to make a decimal an integer, we do it as follows:

```python
number = 4.78
Mybox = int(number)
```

Here, ``int()`` just converts the decimal number by just taking die integer part of ``number``. The value in ``Mybox`` becomes 4.

2.2. Writing Numbers in the Variables to the Screen

Example 2.2: Consider the following example.

```python
nicebox = 10
```

**Question: ** When you run that program, you did not see anything on the screen.  Why?

Suppose we would like to write the money in '``nicebox``' to the screen.

Open a new file, write the code below, name it as '``nicebox2.py``', save it on the desktop and run it.

```python
nicebox = 10
print(nicebox)
```

**Question:** What did you see on the screen when you run the program?



Exercise 2.1: What will you see on the screen after running the program below?

```python
nicebox = 10.3
nicebox = 7.51
print(nicebox)
```

Exercise 2.2: What will you see on the screen after running the program below?

```python
nicebox = 123
anotherbox = 21.186
print(nicebox)
print(anotherbox)
```

We can output multiple expressions with ``print``. For instance,

<br>

<center> - 14 - </center>
