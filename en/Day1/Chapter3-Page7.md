3.11**) Write a program that sorts three given numbers from smallest to largest.

```
Sample input:                      Sample output:
12                                  7
1                                   11
11                                  12
```

3.12) Every morning at 10 am, Lucy looks at the thermometer and the humidity meter and decides what to eat or drink according to the temperature and the humidity levels. The following table shows what Lucy eats or drinks in what conditions. For example, if the temperature is 45°F and the humidity is 53% then Lucy eats cake.


```
                      Temperature < 60°F                 Temperature > 60°F
Humidity < 40%        Lucv drinks coffee                 Lucv drinks iced tea
Humidity >= 40%       Lucy eats cake                     Lucy eats ice cream
```


Write a program that reads two integers, the temperature and the humidity accordingly, and writes what Lucy does.

```
Sample input:                      Sample output:
45                                  Lucy eats cake
53
```

3.13) Write the same program with the conditions below.

```
                        Temperature < 60°F                 Temperature > 60°F
Humidity < 40%          Lucv drinks coffee                 Lucv drinks iced tea
40% =< Humiditv < 60%   Lucy plays tennis                  Lucv plays golf
Humidity >= 60%         Lucy eats cake                     Lucy eats ice cream

```
