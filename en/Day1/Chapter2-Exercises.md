**2.1 Make a variable named ``nicebox`` and put 10 in it. Then output ``nicebox`` on the screen.**

2.2 Suppose you have three boxes, ``Box1``, ``Box2``, and ``Box3``. ``Box1`` and ``Box2`` contain 11 and 5 respectively. Write a program that adds the numbers in two boxes, puts it in ``Box3``, and outputs ``Box3`` to the screen.

**Suppose we have a box called ``arithbox``. Write a program that puts the result of ``213 * 4 - 10`` into ``arithbox`` and writes the value of ``arithbox`` on the screen.**

2.4 Suppose we have two boxes, ``box1`` and ``box2``. Write a program that puts the result of ``(207 + 181) / 2`` into ``box1`` then it writes ``box1`` to the screen. Next, it multiplies ``box1`` by 3, adds 25 and puts the result into ``box2``. Finally, it writes ``box2`` on the screen.

**2.5 Write a program that puts the result of ``363 / 3`` into ``box1``. Next, it adds 2 to ``box1``. Then multiplies ``box1`` by 11 and puts the result into ``box2``. Finally, it writes ``box2`` then ``box1`` to the screen in different lines.**

2.6 Write a program that puts two numbers read from keyboard into ``box1`` and ``box2``. Then it puts the half of the sum of ``box1`` and ``box2`` into ``box3`` and it writes ``box3`` on the screen.

**2.7 Write a program that reads two numbers from the keyboard and put them into ``box1`` and ``box2``. Then it puts the multiplication of ``box1`` and ``box2`` into ``box3`` and it writes ``box3`` on the screen.**

2.8 Write a program calculates the area of the given rectangle. The length of the rectangle is 219 and the width is 72. You will use three variables in your program; ``length``, ``width`` and ``area``. Put the values into ``length`` and ``width`` then calculate ``area`` using necessary formula. At the end, write ``area`` to the screen.

**2.9 Write a program that calculates the number of minutes in a year. You will have three variables; ``day``, ``hour`` and ``minute``. Put the number of days in a year into the variable ``day``. Then, multiply ``day`` by the number of hours in a day, and put the result into the variable ``hour``. Finally, multiply ``hour`` by the number of minutes in an hour, and put the result into the variable ``minute``. At the end, write the variable ``minute`` to the screen.**

2.10 Write a program that calculates the average of three numbers. Your program should read three numbers from keyboard then put the average of these three numbers into ``average3`` (you are free to choose the variable names). At the end, it should write integer value of ``average3`` to the screen.

**2.11 Write a program calculates your age in 2015 when you enter your birth year from the keyboard.**
