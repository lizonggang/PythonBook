###### Variahles - Integer and Float

<table><tr><td bgcolor=#FFE4C4>
secondsInADay = 86400<br>
print("There are", secondsInADay, "seconds in one day.")
</td></tr></table>

will output;

```python
There are 86400 seconds in one day.
```

In Python, it doesn’t matter if an expression is in one line or separated into
multiple lines. For example, the following codes are the same:

<table><tr><td bgcolor=#FFE4C4>

print("There are", <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;secondsInADay, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"seconds in one day.")
</td></tr></table>



### 2.3. Arithmetic Operations on Variables

Suppose we have to three boxes two of which have some money in them. Then
we can get money in these two boxes and put all the money into the third box.
Similarly, suppose we have three variables named ``Box1``, ``box2``, and ``Box1`` where ``Box1`` and ``Box2`` contain the numbers ``11`` and ``5`` respectively. We can add the number in Box1 and ``Box2`` and put the sum into ``Box3``. However, we do not lose the numbers in the boxes; they also remain the same.

Example 2.3: Suppose you have two three boxes, Box1, Box2, and Box3. Box1 and
Box2 contain 11 and 5 respectively. Write a Python program that adds the numbers
in two boxes, puts it in Box3, and outputs Box3 to the screen.

```python
Box1 = 11
Box2 = 5
Box3 = Box1 + Box2
print(Box3)
```

Output.

We can use the arithmetic operators, addition (+), subtraction (-), division (/),
multiplication (*) and parenthesis ‘()’ in the same way we use in math.
