Exercise 3.1: Read two numbers from the keyboard and find the greater of these
two numbers.

Sample input:

```python
5
8
```

Sample output:

```python
8
```

Question: Can we write the program without using else in the if statement?
How?

problem.

### 3.3. Relational Operators

We can use the following the following operators that we learned in math in if conditions.

|Condition|Meanine
|:---|:---
|A == B|A is equal to B
|A != B|A is not eaual to B
|A < B|A is less than (<) B
|A > B|A is areater than (>) B
|A <= B|A is less than or eaual to (=<) B
|A> = B|A is areater than or equal to (>=) B


> [!NOTE]
> ‘A = B’ is different than ‘a == b’. ‘a = b’ means ‘assign the value of B to A’<br>
> whereas <br>
> ‘A == B’ means ‘A is equal to B’. ‘A == B’ has the same meaning of ‘A = B’ in **math**.
