###### Conditionals
---

Exercise 3.2: Fill in the following program code so that the program reads two
numbers from the keyboard and finds the greater of these two numbers.

```python
numberl = int(input())
number2 = int(input())

if ____:
    print(number2)
else:
    print(number1)
```

Exercise 3.3: Read three positive numbers from the keyboard and write the ones with the remainder 3 from the division by 6.

Sample input:

```python
11
9
15
```

Sample output:

```python
9
15
```


### 3.4. Logical Operators

Suppose Dane says “if it rains and I'm outside, I use my umbrella”.
Consider the conditional statement below:
           If x is greater than 5 and less than 10, write ‘x is less than 4’.

Example 3.3: Write a program that reads a number from the keyboard and writes ‘x is less than 4’ if the given number is greater than 5 and less than 10.

```python
x = int(input ())         # read x from keyboard
if x > 5 and x < 10:      # if x is greater than 5 and less than 10
    print("x is less than 4")
```

Consider the conditional statement below:
          If x is greater than 5 or less than 10, write ‘x is less than 4’.
Suppose Peter says “if it rains or I'm outside, I use my umbrella else I wear my
sunglasses”.
