### 2.1. Variables

We can consider variables as boxes. We can save money in our box; similarly,
we can save numbers into variables. Every variable box has a name.

Whenever we need, we can take and put the money in the box, similarly we can
access the number in the box and put a new number.

> [!NOTE]
> We have to be careful about variable names; they do not contain space
and they are case sensitive. MyBox and myBox are considered as two different
variables.

> [!NOTE]
> The first character of a variable name has to be a letter, the rest can be
letters, numbers, or underscore.


For instance, '``My_3rd_Box``' is a valid variable name whereas '``3rdMyBox``' not since it starts with a number.

Example 2.1: We will buy a box that has the name '``nicebox``' and put $10 in that box.

Open a new file, write the code below, name it as '``nicebox.py``', save it on the desktop and run it.

```python
nicebox = 10
```

> [!NOTE]
> Equal sign (=) in Python, is not the same as the equal sign in math. In math, equal sign means 'the results on both sides of the equality are equal'. On the other hand, in Python equal sign means 'put the number on the right side into the box on the leftside'.
