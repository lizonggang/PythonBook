```
Input                       Result
12                          This is an even number
```

<br>

**3.10** Write a program that finds the smallest of three numbers given.

```
Input                       Result
7                           3
3
10
```

<br>

**3.11** Write a program that writes "``divisible``" if the first number is divisible by the second. Otherwise it will write "``not divisible``". Both numbers are positive integers.


```
Input                       Result
36                          not divisible
5
```

<br>

**3.12** Write a program that outputs "``sum of two``" if the sum of any two of the three given numbers is equal to the other one. If the product of any two is equal to the remaining one then write "``product of two``". The user will enter three numbers from the keyboard.

```
Input                       Result
1                           sum of two

**3.14** Every morning at 10 am, Lucy looks at the thermometer and the humidity meter and decides what to eat or drink according to the temperature and the humidity levels. The following table shows what Lucy eats or drinks in what conditions. For example, if the temperature is 45°F and the humidity is 53% then Lucy eats cake.

```
                      Temperature < 60°F                 Temperature >= 60°F
Humidity < 40%        Lucv drinks coffee                 Lucv drinks iced tea
Humidity >= 40%       Lucy eats cake                     Lucy eats ice cream
```


Write a program that reads two integers, the temperature and the humidity accordingly, and writes what Lucy does.

```
Input                       Result
45                          Lucy eats cake
53
```

**3.15** Every morning at 10 am, Lucy looks at the thermometer and the humidity meter and decides what to eat or drink according to the temperature and the humidity levels. The following table shows what Lucy eats or drinks in what conditions. For example, if the temperature is 45°F and the humidity is 53% then Lucy plays tennis.

```
                        Temperature < 60°F                 Temperature >= 60°F
Humidity < 40%          Lucv drinks coffee                 Lucv drinks iced tea
40% =< Humiditv < 60%   Lucy plays tennis                  Lucv plays golf
Humidity >= 60%         Lucy eats cake                     Lucy eats ice cream
```

Write a program that reads two integers, the temperature and the humidity accordingly, and writes what Lucy does.

```
Input                       Result
45                          Lucy plays tennis
