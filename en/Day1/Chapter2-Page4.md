###### Programming with Python
---

Example 2.4: Suppose we have a box called ``arithbox``. The following Python program puts the result of ‘``213 * 4 - 10``’ into ``arithbox`` and writes the value of arithbox to the screen.


```python
airthbox = 213 * 4 - 10
print(arithbox)
```

Output.

```
842
```


Example 2.5: Suppose we have two boxes, ``box1`` and ``box2``. The following Python
program puts the result of ‘``(2007 + 1881) / 2``’into ``box1`` then it writes ``box1`` to the screen. Next, it multiplies ``box1`` by ``3``, adds ``25`` and puts the result into ``box2``.
Finally, it writes box2 to the screen.

```python
box1 = (207+ 181) / 2
print(box1)
box2 = box1 * 3 + 25
print(box2) 
```

Output.

```
194.0
607.0
```

Note that in this example both box1 and box2 became decimal; not integer. The
reason is that the result of division operation (‘/’) is <u>always</u> decimal in Python.

Exercise 2.3: Write a program that puts the result of‘363 / 3’into box1. Next,
it adds 2 to box1, multiply by 11 and puts the result into box2. Finally, it writes
box2 then box1 to the screen.


> [!NOTE]
> Division and Remainder Operations
> In Python, division operator is ‘/’ whereas remainder is ‘%’ for integers.
> Example. ‘6 / 3’is equal to 2. ‘7 % 3’is equal to 1 since the remainder of division of 7 by 3 is 1.
