###### Programming with Python
---

Exercise 7.7: Write a program that reads a number N from the input. Then, your
program will print a figure that has n rows in triangle from. The first row will have
only 1, and the second row will have 1 and 2. It will continue until the nth row
will have the numbers from 1 to N. See the example below for clarity. Be careful
about the blank between numbers.

```
样本输入：
4
```

```
样本输出：
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
```

** Exercise 7.8: Solve the same problem without using nested loops.

Exercise 7.9: Write a program that reads a number N then N numbers from the
input. Your program will print a figure that has N rows. The numbers given in the
input specify the number o f i n their row consequently. See the example below
for clarity.

```
Sample input:
5
3 4 6 0 3
```

```
Sample output:
***
****
*****

***
```



Exercise 7.10: Write a program that reads n < 1000 then n numbers each of which
is between 1 and 1000 inclusively from the input. Then, your program will find
the numbers that exist more than once and output them.

** Exercise 7.11: Solve the same problem without using nested loops.
