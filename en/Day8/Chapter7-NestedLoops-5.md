### 7.1. Challenging Problems

Exercise 7.12: Adapted from Amicable Numbers (BIO '96)

Two numbers are said to be “amicable” if they are different and the sum of the
divisors of each number (including 1 but excluding the number itself) equals the
other number.

For example: 2620 is divisible by 1,2,4, 5, 10, 20, 131,262, 524, 655, and 1310;
these add up to 2924. 2924 is divisible by 1,2,4, 17,34,43, 68, 86,172,731, and
1462; these add up to 2620. Therefore 2620 and 2924 are amicable. Find the
amicable numbers between 1 and 5,000.

Exercise 7.13: Write a program which finds the number of primes that are less
than the given number.

```
Sample input:
20
```

```
Sample output:
8
```

There are 8 primes less than 20; 2, 3, 5, 7,11, 13, 17, and 19.

Exercise 7.14: Write a program that finds the maximum sum subsequence given a sequence of numbers. You will first read n then n numbers from the input. Output the maximum sum. There will be maximum 100 numbers, and each number will be less than 100.

```
Sample input:
20
9  -7 0 11 -99 2 2 3 1 0 3 1 0 2 -8 5 4 -7 3 1
```

```
Sample output:
15
```

subsequence is 2 2 3 1 0 3 1 0 2 -8 5 4.
