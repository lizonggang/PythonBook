**Question 1**

(Adapted from Amicable Numbers - BIO'96)

Two numbers are said to be "amicable" if they are different and the sum of the divisors of each number (including 1 but excluding the number itself) equals the other number.

For example: 2620 is divisible by 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 131, 262, 524, 655, and 1310; these add up to 2924. 2924 is divisible by 1, 2, 4, 17, 34, 43, 68, 86, 172, 731, and 1462; these add up to 2620. Therefore 2620 and 2924 are amicable. 

Find the amicable numbers between 1 and 10,000. Output each pair in one line, smaller number first then the larger number. The output should be in increasing order.

**Question 2**

Write a program which finds the primes that are less than the given number N < 100,000.

**For example:**

Input|Result
-|-
20|2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19

**Question 3**

Write a program that finds a subsequence of a sequence of numbers such that the sum of the subsequence is maximum. The subsequence has to be contiguous. 

You will first read n then n numbers. You just need to output the sum of the subsequence. There will be maximum 100 numbers, and each number will between -100 and 100 inclusively.

For the sample input the maxumum sum subsequence is 2 2 3 1 0 3 1 0 2 -8 5 4.

**For example:**

Input|Result
-|-
20|15
9 -7 0 11 -99 2 2 3 1 0 3 1 0 2 -8 5 4 -7 3 1|
