###### Nested Conditions
---

The block in the lines 6-9 belongs to the i£ condition ‘temperature < 60’. The
else in line 10 corresponds to the condition ‘temperature >= 60’， and the block
in lines 11-14 belongs to it.

In the last exercise, we grouped the conditions into two groups by their
temperatures. Similarly, if we look at the humidity values we observe that two of
them share one condition while the other two share another condition. So, we can
group them by their humidity levels as well. Another way of using nested ifs is
to check their humidity levels first, and then the temperatures to decide. This
approach is just the swapping the conditions in the previous one. The following
chart summarizes the approach:

Exercise 6.1: Write the same program in the previous exercise checking the humidity and then checking the temperature in nested ifs.

Exercise 6.2: Write the same program with the conditions below without using nested ifs. 

&nbsp;|**Temperature < 60°F**|**Temperature >= 60°F**
-|-|-
**Humidity<40%**|Lucy drinks coffee|Lucy drinks iced tea
**40% <= Humidity < 60%**|Lucy plays tennis|Lucy plays golf
**Humidity >= 60%**|Lucy eats cake|Lucy eats ice cream

Exercise 6.3: Write the same program using nested ifs.
