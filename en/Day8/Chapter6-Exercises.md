**Question 1**

Every morning at 10 am, Lucy looks at the thermometer and the humidity meter and decides what to eat or drink according to the temperature and the humidity levels. The following table shows what Lucy eats or drinks in what conditions. For example, if the temperature is 45°F and the humidity is 53% then Lucy eats cake.

&nbsp;|Temperature < 60°F |Temperature >= 60°F
-|-|-
Humidity < 40%|Lucy drinks coffee|Lucy drinks iced tea
Humidity >= 40%|Lucy eats cake|Lucy eats ice cream

Write a program that reads two numbers, the temperature and the humidity accordingly, and outputs what Lucy does. You **<u>cannot</u>** use nested ifs.

**For example:**

Input|Result
-|-
45 53|Lucy eats cake

<br>

**Question 2**

**Question 3**

Every morning at 10 am, Lucy looks at the thermometer and the humidity meter and decides what to eat or drink according to the temperature and the humidity levels. The following table shows what Lucy eats or drinks in what conditions. For example, if the temperature is 45°F and the humidity is 53% then Lucy eats cake.

&nbsp;|Temperature < 60°F |Temperature >= 60°F
-|-|-

Humidity >= 40%|Lucy eats cake|Lucy eats ice cream

Write a program that reads two numbers, the temperature and the humidity accordingly, and outputs what Lucy does. **<u>Use</u>** nested ifs. In nested ifs, check **<u>the humidity first then the temperature</u>.**

**For example:**

Input|Result
-|-
45 53|Lucy eats cake

<br>

**Question 4**

The following table shows what Lucy eats or drinks in what conditions. For example, if the temperature is 45°F and the humidity is 53% then Lucy eats cake.

&nbsp;|Temperature < 60°F |Temperature >= 60°F
-|-|-
Humidity < 40%|Lucy drinks coffee|Lucy drinks iced tea
40% <= Humidity < 60%|Lucy plays tennis|Lucy plays golf
Humidity >= 60%|Lucy eats cake|Lucy eats ice cream


Write a program that reads two numbers, the temperature and the humidity accordingly, and outputs what Lucy does. You **<u>cannot</u>** use nested ifs.

**For example:**

Input|Result
-|-
45 53|Lucy plays tennis

**Question 6**

Every morning at 10 am, Lucy looks at the thermometer and the humidity meter and decides what to eat or drink according to the temperature and the humidity levels. The following table shows what Lucy eats or drinks in what conditions. For example, if the temperature is 45°F and the humidity is 53% then Lucy eats cake.

&nbsp;|Temperature < 60°F |Temperature >= 60°F
-|-|-
Humidity < 40%|Lucy drinks coffee|Lucy drinks iced tea
40% <= Humidity < 60%|Lucy plays tennis|Lucy plays golf
Humidity >= 60%|Lucy eats cake|Lucy eats ice cream


This time you will have temperature and humidity information for more days. You will output the days Lucy plays tennis or golf. In the input, the first line will provide N, the number of days. Upcoming N lines will provide the temperature and humidity information for these days.


**For example:**

Input|Result
-|-
4|Day 2: Lucy plays tennis
45 83|Day 4: Lucy plays golf
58 58|
77 32|
77 40|
