###### Programming with Python

Exercise 6.4: Consider the same example, but this time you will have
temperature and humidity information for more days. You will output the days
Lucy plays tennis or golf. In the input, the first line will provide n, the number of days. Upcoming N lines will provide the temperature and humidity information
for these days.

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
4                           Day 2: Lucy plays tennis
45 83                       Day 4: Lucy plays golf
58 58
77 32
77 40
```


Exercise 6.5: Lucy wants to calculate her bonus points she earned while shopping.
She knows how much she spent in her last N < 100 shopping, and all of them are
bakery, produce, or drinks.
- If they are bakery, she earns 5 points per dollar.
- If they are produce, she earns 2 points per dollar.
- If they are drinks, she earns 1 point per dollar.

She earns bonus points when she spends more than M dollars in one shopping.
You will first read N then N numbers corresponding to the money Lucy spend. At
the end, you will read M then the type of shopping items. 1 means they are all
bakery, 2 and 3 correspond to produce and drinks respectively. Write the total
bonus points to the output.


```
Sample input:               Sample output:
5                           800
41 13 88 50 72
50 1
```

Lucy receives bonus points for shopping more than $50 hence $88 and S72 are
qualified for bonus. Her shopping was on bakery which brings 5 points per dollar.
In total, she got (88 + 72) * * 5 = 800 bonus points.

Exercise 6.6: Sort given tree numbers from smaller to larger without using loops
and nested ifs.

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
4 1 13 27                   13 27 41
```

*Exercise 6.7: Sort given tree numbers from smaller to larger using nested ifs
but not loops.
