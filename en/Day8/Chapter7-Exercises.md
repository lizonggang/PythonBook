**Question 1**

Write a program which prints all two-digit numbers that can be composed of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

**Question 2**

Write a program which prints all two-digit numbers that can be composed of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} in the following order:

            50 51 52 53 54 55 40 41 42 43 44 45 ... 10 11 12 13 14 15

Be careful that ones digit increases while tens digit decreases.


**Question 3**

Write a program which prints all two digit odd numbers that can be composed of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} using nested loops.

**Question 4**

Write a program which prints all two digit odd numbers that can be composed of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} **<u>without</u>** using nested loops.


**Question 5**

Write a program which prints all three digit numbers that can be composed of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} using nested loops.


**Question 6**

Write a program that reads two numbers N (0 < N < 10) and M (0 < M < 25) from the input. Then, your program will print a figure on the screen that has N number of rows and M number of columns. The first row will have with M number of 1s, and the second row will have M number of 2s. It will continue until the Nth row will have M number of Ns. See the example below for clarity.

**For example:**


Input|Result
-|-
3 4|1111
&nbsp;|2222
&nbsp;|3333


**Question 7**

Write a program that reads a number N (0 < N < 25) from the input. Then, your program will print a figure on the screen that has N rows in triangle from. The first row will have only 1, and the second row will have 1 and 2. It will continue until the Nth row will have the numbers from 1 to N. See the example below for clarity. Be careful about the blank between numbers.

**For example:**

Input|Result
-|-
4|1
&nbsp;|1 2
&nbsp;|1 2 3
&nbsp;|1 2 3 4


**Question 8**

Write a program that reads a number N then N numbers from the input. Your program will print a figure on the screen that has N rows. The numbers given in the input specify the number of '*' in their row consequently. See the example below for clarity.

**For example:**

Input|Result
-|-
5|***
3 4 6 0 3|****
&nbsp;|******
&nbsp;|
&nbsp;|***


**Question 9**

Write a program that reads n < 1000 then n numbers each of which is between 1 and 1000 inclusively. Then, your program will find the numbers that exist more than once and output them in **<u>increasing order</u>**.

For example:

Input|Result
-|-
10|1
3 4 6 1 3 7 1 1000 3 6|3
&nbsp;|6
