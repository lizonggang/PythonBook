``` 

<br>

**Question 14**

Write a program reads two strings s1, s2 from the keyboard then writes the position of s2 in s1 if s2 is found in s1. Otherwise it writes 'not found!'.

**For example:**

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
HelloWorld!                 3
loW 
HelloWorld!                 not found!
Low

```
