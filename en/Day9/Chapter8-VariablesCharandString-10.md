### 8.7. Exercises

**8.11)** Lucy wants to calculate her bonus points she earned while shopping- She knows how much she spent in her last N =< 100 shopping, and all of them are
``bakery`` ``produce``, or ``drinks``.

- If they are bakery, she earns 5 points per dollar.
- If they are produce, she earns 2 points per dollar.
- If they are drinks, she earns 1 point per dollar.

She earns bonus points when she spends more than M dollars in one shopping.
You will first read N then N numbers corresponding to the money Lucy spend. At
the end, you will read M then the type of shopping items. Write the total bonus
points on the screen.

```
Sample input:                    Sample output:
5                                800
41 13 88 50 72
50 bakery
```


Lucy receives bonus points for shopping more than $50 hence $88 and $72 are
qualified for bonus. Her shopping was on bakery which brings 5 points per dollar.
In total, she got (88 + 72) * 5 = 800 bonus points.

```

I, c, a, K, e, and s are the letters.

**8.13\*)** Write a program that converts all letters to uppercase in a given string.

```
Sample input:                    Sample output:
I8-10caKes！                     I8-10CAKES！
```

**8.14\*\*)** Write a program that checks if two given strings are the same regardless of the case differences. If the strings are same, write '``same``' otherwise '``not same``'。

```
Sample input:                    Sample output:
Trivial Trival                   not same
```

```
Sample input:                    Sample output:
