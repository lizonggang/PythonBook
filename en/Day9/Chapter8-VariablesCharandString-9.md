###### Variables — Char and String

A specific position of a string in a string array can be reached as follows:

```python
print(myStrings[5][3])
```

prints the character at position 3 of string 5 in myStrings array on the screen.

```python
print(myStrings[5][3:8])
```

prints the substring that starts at position 3 and has length 6 of string 5 in myStrings array on the screen.


Exercise 10: Write a program reads an integer n then n words and a string 5 from the input. Erase s from any word it contains s. Write the new words on the screen. There will be maximum 100 strings in the input.

```
Sample input:                    Sample output:
4                                Helloworld! 
Helloworld!                      wer
lower                            trial
trial                            Hel
Hello
lo
```

The string  '``lo``' s erased from the words '``Helloworld!``'，'``lower``'和'``Hello``'.
