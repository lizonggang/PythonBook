###### Variables - Char and String
---


**8.15\*)** Write a program that reads a string and writes the number of digits in that string on the screen.

```
Sample input:                   Sample output:
I8-10caKes！                    3
```

of them are digits; 8, 1, and 0.


**8.16\*)** Complete the following program so that it reverses a given string. Notethat **you cannot declare another string**.

```python
s = input ()

#Write your code here

print (s)
```

```
Sample input:                   Sample output:
Reverse！                   !esreveR
```


**8.17\*)** Write a program that reads two strings from the keyboard and checks if the number of vowels in these strings are equal.


```
Sample input:                   Sample output:
ThReE VoWeLs                    Same number of vowels.
```

```
Sample input:                   Sample output:
twO VoWeLs                      Not same number of vowels.
```

In the first input, both strings have two vowels whereas in the second one, the
first siring has only one vowel.

**8.18\*\*\*)** Write a program that reads a number =< 20 from the keyboard and prints the spiral of asterisks on the screen as shown below.

```
Sample:n = 5                    Sample:n = 8
*****                           ********
*                               *
* ***                           * ******
*   *                           * *    *
*****                           * *  * *
                                * **** *
                                *      *
                                ********
```

**8.19\*)** Write a program that reads a numbers ``x`` and a character ``c`` from the keyboard. The program outputs a square with the size ``x`` filled with character ``c``.
