###### Programming with Python
---

**4.12\*\*)** Write a program that outputs the sum of the first 5 numbers and the last number (the number before 0). The program terminates when the input is 0 (it is
guaranteed that there are at least 5 numbers).

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
9                               1223
10
11
185
7
3
12
4
1001
0
```

**4.13)**  Write a program which prints all two-digit numbers that can be composed
of {0, 1,2,3,4,5}.

**4.14)**  Write a program which prints all two-digit numbers that can be composed
of {0, 1, 2, 3,4, 5} in the following order:

```
        50 51 52 53 54 55 40 41 42 43 44 45 ... 10 11 12 13 14 15
```

Be careful that Is digit increases while 10s digit decreases.

**4.15\*)** Write a program which prints all two digit odd numbers that can be
composed of (0, 1,2, 3,4, 5, 6}.

**4.16\*)** Write a program which prints all three digit numbers that can be composed of {0, 1,2, 3,4}.

**4.17\*\*)** Write a program that finds all the 3-digit numbers that composed of (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and whose digits are distinct.

**4.18\*\*)** “Guess my number" game is a two player game. One of the players
becomes the master and picks up a number between 1 and 100 inclusively, and
the other player tries to guess the number in his mind. After each guess, if the
wanted number is less or greater than the guessed number then the master says
“less” or “greater", respectively. This goes on until the correct guess is achieved.
