###### Programming with Python
---

**Exercise 4.6:** Write a program that finds the sum of n numbers given. The user should enter n, then numbers from keyboard.

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
5                           47
22
1
4
8
```

The following table shows the values of the variables ``counter``, ``number``, and ``sum`` at each step in the loop for the sample input.
Step|``counter``|``number``|``sum``
-|-|-|-
Initial|0||0
1|1|22|22
2|2|1|23
3|3|12|35
4|4|4|39
5|5|8|47

**Exercise 4.7:** Write a program that reads numbers and outputs if they are between
17 and 35 inclusively. Otherwise program stops.

Sample input:

Here '>' specifies the inputs by the user, the rest is the output by program.

```python
> 19
Â 19
> 25
25
> 32
32
> 16
```

There are some shortcut operations in place of some arithmetic operations. They
are given in the following table:

Operator|Example|Equivalent expression
-|-|-
+=|number += 10|number = number + 10
-=|number -= 10|number = number - 10
*=|number *= 10|number = number * 10
/=|number /= 10|number = number / 10
