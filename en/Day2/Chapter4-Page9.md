###### Looping
---

In this program, computer is the master and the user guesses the number of
computer. In the program, you will define a variable named ``secretnumber`` which
contains the secret number. You will assign the number to it inside the program.
For example, write

```
             secretnumber = 6;
```

in your program if you want the number to be 6. In each step, the user asks for a
number. If the secret number is less than the guessed number, the computer writes
“less”. If it is greater, it writes “greater”. If it is the correct number it writes
“correct!”, and the game finishes.

Suppose the secret number is 7.

Sample: '>' indicates the numbers user entered

```
> 3
  greater
> 6
  greater
> 9
  small
> 7
  right！
```

**4.19\*\*\*)** Consider the “Guess my number" game above. This time, the user is the
master and the computer guesses the number of the user. In each step, computer
asks for a number. If the user’s number is less than the guessed number, the user
enters -1. If it is greater, the user enters 1. If it is the correct number, the user enters 0, and the game finishes. Try to find the number as fast as possible.

Suppose the user’s number is 7.

Sample: '>' indicates the numbers user entered

```
3
> 1
6
> 1
  9
> -l
 7
> 0
```

**4.20\*\*)** Write a program that reverses the given number.

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
2431                        1342
```

**4.21\*\*)** Write a program that reads two numbers N and M from the input. Then,
your program will print a figure on the screen that has N number of rows and M number of columns. The first row will have with M number of Is, and the second
row will have M number of 2s. It will continue until the Nth row will have M
number of Ns. See the example below for clarity.

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
3                           1111
4                           2222
                            3333
```
