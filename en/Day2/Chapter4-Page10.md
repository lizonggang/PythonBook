###### Programming with Python
---

**4.22\*\*)** Write a program that reads a number N from the input. Then, your
program will print a figure on the screen that has u rows in triangle from. The first row will have only 1, and the second row will have 1 and 2. It will continue until the nth row will have the numbers from 1 to N. See the example below for clarity.
Be careful about the blank between numbers.

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
4                           1
                            1 2
                            1 2 3
                            1 2 3 4
```

**4.23\*\*\*)** Write a program that reads a number N then N numbers from the input
Your program will print a figure on the screen that hasN rows. The numbers given
in the input specify the number ofin their row consequently. See the example
below for clarity.

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
5                           ***
3                           ****
4                           *****
6
0                           ***
3
```

**4.24\*\*\*)** Write a program which prints the output below when 4 and 7 are given
as input. The program reads two numbers; N and M from keyboard.

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
4                           12 34 56 7
7                           23 45 67 8
                            34 56 78 9
                            4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

<br>

**4.25\*\*\*)** Write a program which finds the primes that are less than the given
number.

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
20                          2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19
```
