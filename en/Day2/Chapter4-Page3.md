Exercise 4.3: Write a program that reads numbers and outputs if they are greater
than x. Program will stop when 0 is given. The user will first input the number x.

```
Sample input:                   Sample output:
11                              8
8                               11

7
5
0
```

Exercise 4.4: Write a program that outputs the numbers from 1 to n. The user
should give the value of n.

Sample input:

```
6
```

Sample output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
```


Exercise 4.5: Write a program that finds the nlh power of 2 where n will be given
as input and n > 0.

```
Sample input:                   Sample output:
5                               32
```
