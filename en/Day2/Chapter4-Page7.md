> cannot use nested loops when solving the following exercises.

**4.8)** rite a program that outputs only the numbers that have remainder 3 when
divided by 7. The program stops when 0 is entered.

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
9                           10
10                          185
11                          3
185
7
3
0
```

**4.9)**  Write a program that outputs the sum of the squares of the given numbers.
The program stops when 0 is entered.

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
9                           239
10
7
3
0
```

**4.10\*)** Given a positive integer n, write a program that applies the following
procedure until n becomes 1. if n is even, divide n by 2. Otherwise, multiply n by  
three and add 1 to it.

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
40                          40
                            20
                            10
                            5
                            16
                            8
                            4
                            2
                            1
```

**4.11\*)** Write a program that outputs the sum of the first 5 numbers. The program
terminates when the input is 0 (it is guaranteed that there are at least 5 numbers).

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
9                           222
10
11
