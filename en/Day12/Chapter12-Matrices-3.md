Exercise 12.1: Read two integers n and m then a matrix of size (n, m) from the
input. Vertically flip the matrix and output it. The size of the matrix will not be more than (100, 100).

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
3 4                         2 3 5 3
1 2 2 1                     4 5 5 3 
4 5 5 3                     1 2 2 1 
2 3 5 3
```


*Exercise 12.2: Read an integer n then a matrix of size (n, n) from the input. Flip the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output it. The size of the matrix will not be more than (100, 100).

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
4                           9 2 4 1
1 2 2 1                     8 3 5 2 
4 5 5 3                     7 5 5 2 
2 3 5 3                     6 3 3 1
9 8 7 6
```


Exercise 12.3: Read two integers n and m then two matrices of size (n, m) from
the input. Add the values at the same positions of these matrices, and output the summation matrix. The size of the matrices will not be more than (100, 100).

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
3 4                         10 10 9 7
1 2 2 1                     5 5 9 2
4 5 5 3                     5 6 8 6
2 3 5 3                     

9 8 7 6
1 0 4 -1
3 3 3 3
```
