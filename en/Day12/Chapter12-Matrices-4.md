### 12.2. Matrix Initialization

Matrices can be initialized while defining as in arrays:

```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 2, 1], [4, 5, 5, 3], [2, 3, 5, 3]]
```


### 12.3. Matrices as Mazes and Graphs

Matrices can be used for different purposes than just numbers such as representing
mazes and graphs.

*Exercise 12.4:

You will be given a map of a maze and a path. Check ifthe path is a correct way to the exit. You will start at position (1,1), and exit is at (1, mâ€”1). An example maze of size (7, 6) is given below. Starting and exit locations
are shown as *S' and lE'. A path is shown with red color to the exit.

```
Sample input:               Sample output:
7 6                         Right path!
1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 0 1
1 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
ddrdrruulurr
```

You will first read the size of the maze (n, m). Then the maze will be given as a matrix size of (n, m); 1 's are walls, 0's are empty locations. The size of the matrix will not be more than (100, 100). The path is given as a string composed of four different letters; 'l' means 'left', 'r' means 'right', 'u' means 'up', and 'd' means 'down'.
