###### Reading / Writing Files
Here, we determine N by ourselves by incrementing each time reading a number
from the input file. We first make an infinite loop based on the loop condition by writing “``True``”. In the loop, the variable ``value`` tries to read from file in each turn. Whenever there is no more input, it will be empty and it will exit the loop.

``Exercise 10.1``: Solve the same problem without using arrays.
